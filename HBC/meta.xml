  <short_description>BlueBomb a Wii from your Wii!</short_description>
  <long_description>BlueMii is a port of Fullmetal5's BlueBomb exploit for Broadcom's Bluetooth stack used in the Nintendo Wii, *to* the Nintendo Wii. This means you can use the Bluetooth capabilities of one Wii to install homebrew on another Wii.

This probably isn't useful to most people, but it was fun to work on.

The stage1 payload is taken from Aep's fork, which adds SD card support.</long_description>
